# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## 1. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

<!-- 
  Describe what the user can do. Focus on the most important user journeys first.
  Use the Given/When/Then format for acceptance criteria.
-->

### User Story 1: [Brief, descriptive title]

As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action] so that I can [achieve some goal].

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** [a precondition], **When** [I perform an action], **Then** [I should see a result].
2. **Given** [another precondition], **When** [I perform a different action], **Then** [I should see another result].

## 4. Definition of Ready (Optional Self-Check)

_Before moving to the `/plan` stage, quickly review this checklist. Is your spec ready for a technical deep-dive?_

#### Clarity & Unambiguity
- [ ] **Vague Terms**: Are words like "fast", "simple", "good" quantified? (e.g., "fast" → "loads in < 1 second").
- [ ] **Assumptions**: Are all implicit assumptions written down?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Have you considered at least one "unhappy path" (e.g., user enters wrong data, network error)?

#### Scope
- [ ] **Boundaries**: Is it crystal clear what is **IN** the MVP and what is **OUT**?
- [ ] **Priorities**: Is the most critical User Story (the "one thing" the MVP must do) clearly marked as #1?

#### Testability
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Can you objectively say "pass" or "fail" for each criterion?
- [ ] **Measurable Success**: Are all success criteria quantifiable and verifiable?

**If you have "no" answers, consider refining the spec with your AI assistant before proceeding.**
